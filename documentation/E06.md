# Documentation for E06

Initial thoughts of this exercise is a sense of questions unanswered and a feeling of an incoming evening of investigating spesifications on cables and devices. 

Previously I do have some experience in patching, having had physical access and a decent control over my last employers "Data room". From there I was aware of the different devices, 
interconnection between them, additions of routers from different operators, ports and cables to different departments in the building, and so forth. 
Usually I was also the person who were responsible to guard and follow technicians working in the room - pulling up new cables and ports and generally doing maintainance. So I did find it quite amusing to watch, and in addition
understanding the infrastructure in the building and how things are connected was a good experience. The lack is though the technical spesifications of each type of device, the different cables between devices I was not familiar with and so on. 
The closest actual networks-educated person were 220km away, and neither of them (3 ppl in an area geographically larger than Denmark) rarely visited. 

I would post a picture of the cabinets/racks but.. it was not a good example as no one did the maintainance nor had a sense of cable management!

All in all good experience, but not very technical in regard of the functions of the devices. The best update I personally managed to get through there 
(seeing that the contents of the data-room was definitely not my field of work, though we needed access since things happend - aaall the time),
was general patching, troubleshooting and restarting devices, and lastly security wise to switch the wooden door to an armored steel door!

# Update and review current physical topology

For the purpose of *$`\textcolor{green}{ \text{visualizing and understanding better}\  } `$*, I adapted the topology to an imaginary company of my own creation. Removing some of the parts and just focusing on devices, lines and locations:

From E05 the actual physical topology would look like the picture below:

# Devices


## Workstations

Starting with the basics, the workstations I need to have a use of any network. From my experience there are many solutions and types of devices that could fit. From the ones that come to mind:

- Larger and more hardware oriented clients where you do the work physically on that computer.
- Smaller thin clients that have limited capacity physically and merely connects the user to a server where the work is being done. 
- Laptops going about the day wirelessly in the office, in meetings and travelling.
- Laptops with docking-stations where the docking stations will have better connectivity, physical cabling and other Quality of life/work as good screens and such.

Considering the plan and setup is a fairly small business, Id still want some kind of physical connections as its more secure and is faster. Going with the last option, laptops with docking stations. 


### Docking station

One example that would be viable for a small business, also price-wise, could be something like the Ugreen alternative as seen below:
Additionally screens, scanner, printer and IO-devices would be neccesary. 

![](/documentation/E06/UgreenDockingStation.png)


### Laptop

Considering the hardware and capacity of a stationary / thick-client, would be beyond those of a laptop - Im guessing also price-wise, it would probably be a good solution to have a few stationary machines. 
Though, since chili-growers are fast-pacing individuals they are constantly on the move, and laptops are really the only real solution. Still they would most likely need an ultrabook of some sort, with the capacity to both
document germination and keep track of plants and progress, as well as edit and create enthusiastic videos. This still would vary from employee to employee depending on tasks and requirements. 

One option that could be viable is Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Nano, where the price varies from around 2000 - 2600 €.

SSD disk, RAM which could vary from 8-32 depending on need, a decent CPU and generally having standard but up to date ports and connectivity.

## Switches

Keeping the office connected and being able to configure properly the networks does require a switch which is more advanced than the home use routers, hubs and such we might have had experience running previously. Being a fairly
small business, the prices of enterprise-marketed network devices will probably be quite considerable. I would initially probably defend having good / suitable workstations that would fit employees needs, 
but at the same time having good network devices would also give options to manage, control and have security as needed. 

Introducing, the Cisco 1000-series enterprise switch - but small, and affordable. Chosing 2 x 16 port switches that will more than cover my current need of all departments and workstations. 
From what Ive gained they are a couple years old, however of all devices I would need the network devices would be the devices that would last the longest, possibly up till 10 years.

At the same time, I do not have a goal to grow the company to exceed the amount of devices connected to them. At most I would expand the network by adding an additional switch.

Chosing 2 switches:

## Routers

When trying to find information about routers, there are alot of options although most of it is standard routers also used for home networks. 
I know, by experience, many businesses use standard home network routers to work as Wireless Access Points in the building, sending out WIFI signals to whichever devices or employee that need that. 
Though finding a router with its purpose of actually routing traffick and working as a gateway in and out of different VLANs and networks, seems to be trickier. 

Many suggestions I find refer to so-called "multilayer switch", which from what I understand is a Layer 2 and additionally Layer 3 OSI model switch that in addition to keeping track of ports and MAC-addresses, also handle IP-addresses like a router would do. 

In the end, I need to find a type of router that would fit, according to the exercise. Though obviously I need to look towards enterprise type routers. The reason is that even though a home router might work for the WIFI, literally every workstation will go through the router - since the chilinetwork is world-wide. 
From what I understand enterprise routers are faster(in itself, not connection-speed-fast), more stable and have better security. Being able to configure, add static routes and if needed having more physical ports would be a bonus. 

```
~~ The first option I checked out was MikroTik Cloud Core Router CCR1009-7G-1C-PC, although at later glance it is discontinued.  Another point would be to have an option as a rack-unit, so it would need to fit.

![](/documentation/E06/Nope1.png)

Another option could be the more simple Linksys LRT214, single WAN at half price of double. I dont see a reason why we would need multiple internet connections at this point
 so a single WAN is sufficient. This option is ideally ment for home use, but could be an alternative as I would not have many employees, considering its affordability. 399 € per. 
 
![](/documentation/E06/Nope2.png) ~~
 ```
 
 Having already chosen Cisco switches, one option I checked out was Cisco 867VAE. It might be overkill compared to the previous alternatives, 
 although it will last longer and having the same manufacturer on devices and possibly same OS cant be bad. Better security and more options. Priced around 570 €.
  
![](/documentation/E06/Router3.png)

In addition to this, I add a fiber module into atleast one of the routers for a connection to the internet. Though after a while, realizing that the Cisco 867VAE does not have a SPF port. The search continues. 

![](/documentation/E06/Fibermodule1.png)

Having had a 2 day session looking for routers.. 

![](/documentation/E06/Routeroptions1.png)

But ending up and chosing a bit pricier version which is still viable for a company this size, but with some future capacity. 

![](/documentation/E06/Endrouter1.png)

Through the last days I scoured through different e-shops I am familiar with, but also new ones, as well as producer webpages. I was thinking that it could be handy for the future to have 2 SPF ports in each router, in case I would like to add fiber internally in the building between devices. 
Then again, with Gigabit Ethernet speeds of 1000 Mbps, it might not be neccesary. Also since I am unfamiliar with these devices, to my knowledge there might even be adapters or smaller units for an affordable price holding the same function. 


 
 ## Modem

To connect with the chili-community connectivity online is required. Despite remembering well the dial up sounds from the early 90s, 
modems in my mind today is a part of the router&accesspoint I have next to my tv, plugged in the wall. 
From what I understand, modems translated the 1s and 0s to high and low electricity signals going through the copper wire.
I have not yet really found any options, and I get the feeling modems are mostly a part of other devices like routers and alike these days. 
I find alot of mobile-broadband routers and such which I have used before for certain OSINT-tasks.

Still throughout the search I start thinking that I need to get a connection between my fiber intake and one of my routers. Maybe a fiber module straight into the router would do? (I added this before finishing the routers. I think it would do the job?)

# Device cabinets - racks and shelves

Searching for device racks that would fit a business of a certain size gives alot of options. Small wall-mounted cabinets would be too limited. For certain rooms that have devices that should be in a cabinet, like additional routers and such, could have these but the data-room needs more space. 
In addition to fit the actual routers, modem and switches - and possibility for expansion - I also need space for ports connecting the devices to each location/office, an RJ45-panel. Many options had wheels, which I guess could be handy if only having some devices.

For good measure and space for a fair amount of RJ45-panels and fiberoptics panels, I end up going for 1 x StarTech 12U Sideways Wall mounted rack. Initially I almost went for the 2 meter high option, but decided otherwise. Price: 540 $

Initially I found a cheap shelf

But comparing something that will fit in the cabinet:

![](/documentation/E06/1UShelf2.png)


2 x CAT6a RJ45 panels, 104€ each:
![](/documentation/E06/RJ45Panel.png)

At a point I did consider going larger. Having a 12U rack initially seemed like it would cover my need. Adding some last bits and pieces, and thinking the 12U cabinet will hold. 2 switches and 2 routers, each 1U. 2 RJ45 panels, each 1U. I dont see the immidiate need to add more components to the rack, so the chosen one will do for now.

# Cabling

From what I understand - despite if a building have a fiber connection, that connection goes to the modem itself. From there, it is divided to the other network devices with fiber cables. 
However - from the switches, which are connected to the RJ45 panels, and from the RJ45 panels up through the building-mass to each office and location, the cables are twisted pairs.
