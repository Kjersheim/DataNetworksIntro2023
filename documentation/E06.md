# Documentation for E06

Initial thoughts of this exercise is a sense of questions unanswered and a feeling of an incoming evening of investigating spesifications on cables and devices. 

Previously I do have some experience in patching, having had physical access and a decent control over my last employers "Data room". From there I was aware of the different devices, 
interconnection between them, additions of routers from different operators, ports and cables to different departments in the building, and so forth. 
Usually I was also the person who were responsible to guard and follow technicians working in the room - pulling up new cables and ports and generally doing maintainance. So I did find it quite amusing to watch, and in addition
understanding the infrastructure in the building and how things are connected was a good experience. The lack is though the technical spesifications of each type of device, the different cables between devices I was not familiar with and so on. 
The closest actual networks-educated person were 220km away, and neither of them (3 ppl in an area geographically larger than Denmark) rarely visited. 

I would post a picture of the cabinets/racks but.. it was not a good example as no one did the maintainance nor had a sense of cable management!

All in all good experience, but not very technical in regard of the functions of the devices. The best update I personally managed to get through there 
(seeing that the contents of the data-room was definitely not my field of work, though we needed access since things happend - aaall the time),
was general patching, troubleshooting and restarting devices, and lastly security wise to switch the wooden door to an armored steel door!

# Update and review current physical topology

For the purpose of *$`\textcolor{green}{ \text{visualizing and understanding better}\  } `$*, I adapted the topology to an imaginary company of my own creation. Removing some of the parts and just focusing on devices, lines and locations:

From E05 the actual physical topology would look like the picture below:

# Devices

## Workstations

Starting with the basics, the workstations I need to have a use of any network. From my experience there are many solutions and types of devices that could fit. From the ones that come to mind:

- Larger and more hardware oriented clients where you do the work physically on that computer.
- Smaller thin clients that have limited capacity physically and merely connects the user to a server where the work is being done. 
- Laptops going about the day wirelessly in the office, in meetings and travelling.
- Laptops with docking-stations where the docking stations will have better connectivity, physical cabling and other Quality of life/work as good screens and such.

Considering the plan and setup is a fairly small business, Id still want some kind of physical connections as its more secure and is faster. Going with the last option, laptops with docking stations. 

### Docking station

One example that would be viable for a small business, also price-wise, could be something like the Ugreen alternative as seen below:
Additionally screens, scanner, printer and IO-devices would be neccesary.

### Laptop

Considering the hardware and capacity of a stationary / thick-client, would be beyond those of a laptop - Im guessing also price-wise, it would probably be a good solution to have a few stationary machines. 
Though, since chili-growers are fast-pacing individuals they are constantly on the move, and laptops are really the only real solution. Still they would most likely need an ultrabook of some sort, with the capacity to both
document germination and keep track of plants and progress, as well as edit and create enthusiastic videos. This still would vary from employee to employee depending on tasks and requirements. 

One option that could be viable is Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Nano, where the price varies from around 2000 - 2600 â‚¬.

SSD disk, RAM which could vary from 8-32 depending on need, a decent CPU and generally having standard but up to date ports and connectivity.
