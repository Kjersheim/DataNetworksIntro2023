# Documentation for E06

Initial thoughts of this exercise is a sense of questions unanswered and a feeling of an incoming evening of investigating spesifications on cables and devices. 

Previously I do have some experience in patching, having had physical access and a decent control over my last employers "Data room". From there I was aware of the different devices, 
interconnection between them, additions of routers from different operators, ports and cables to different departments in the building, and so forth. 
Usually I was also the person who were responsible to guard and follow technicians working in the room - pulling up new cables and ports and generally doing maintainance. So I did find it quite amusing to watch, and in addition
understanding the infrastructure in the building and how things are connected was a good experience. The lack is though the technical spesifications of each type of device, the different cables between devices I was not familiar with and so on. 
The closest actual networks-educated person were 220km away, and neither of them (3 ppl in an area geographically larger than Denmark) rarely visited. 

I would post a picture of the cabinets/racks but.. it was not a good example as no one did the maintainance nor had a sense of cable management!

All in all good experience, but not very technical in regard of the functions of the devices. The best update I personally managed to get through there 
(seeing that the contents of the data-room was definitely not my field of work, though we needed access since things happend - aaall the time),
was general patching, troubleshooting and restarting devices, and lastly security wise to switch the wooden door to an armored steel door!
