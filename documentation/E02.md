# Documentation for E02

##Setting up:
Initially updating my lubuntu-box, and then importing my first switch. Making clones of both, and making sure to name and create new MAC for all boxes/devices. 
\
The lubuntu boxes, named Lubuntu 1 and Lubuntu 2, have 1 network adapter. /
These are both directed to an internal network, pointing to LAN 1 and LAN, respectfully.
/
I start configuring the networks of the two switches, named Network_Switch_A and Network_Switch_B. Both of them have Adapter 1 set to host-only, for management. /
Second, the Adapter 2 and 3 is pointed to for Switch A LAN 1 and 2 (Back to Lubuntu 1 and to what will be the line to Switch B) /
and finally in Switch B - Adapter 2 and 3 respectfully LAN 2 and 3(finishing the connection to Switch A, and to Lubuntu 2)/

Setting the ip and gateway manually - checking that its active, and then trying the first ping between Lubuntu 1 and 2:
