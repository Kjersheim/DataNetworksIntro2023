# Documentation for E02

# Introduction 

## Setting up:
Initially updating my lubuntu-box, and then importing my first switch. Making clones of both, and making sure to name and create new MAC for all boxes/devices. 


The lubuntu boxes, named Lubuntu 1 and Lubuntu 2, have 1 network adapter. 
These are both directed to an internal network, pointing to LAN 1 and LAN 3, respectfully.

I start configuring the networks of the two switches, named Network_Switch_A and Network_Switch_B. 
```
Both of them have Adapter 1 set to host-only, for management. 
Second, the Adapter 2 and 3 is pointed to for Switch A LAN 1 and 2 (Back to Lubuntu 1 and to what will be the line to Switch B) 
and finally in Switch B - Adapter 2 and 3 respectfully LAN 2 and 3(finishing the connection to Switch A, and to Lubuntu 2)
```

The first network diagram at this point: \

Setting the ip and gateway manually - checking that its active, and then trying the first ping between Lubuntu 1 and 2:\

## Configuring the switches:

On both switches I follow the instructions to create the workstation vlan, and re-adding the ports so they are assigned to the newly created vlan. 
Finally, I tag the port for the chosen adapter which is going to the switch, and untag the port used for the adapter to the workstations. 

It took me a few tries trying to figure out which adapter were used for which port.. surprisingly.. untill I figured out it was quite consecutively added. 
From the website networkdirection.net and an article regarding tagged and untagged ports, I did get more information which were also explained in the courses FAQ. 
```
Trying to summarize my findings for future sourcing: \
A VLAN is a group of devices that share a broadcast area. A VLAN can separate different parts of say a building or company, based on whatever is logical, physical or requirements based on department and who to talk to who. 
From my understanding so far VLANs are isolated, so devices within a VLAN can only communicate with other devices within the same VLAN. But..

Untagged - or access VLANS are connected to hosts(often a server) that pass VLAN information to and from each network. 
Tagged - or Trunk VLANs, enable switch access ports to handle more than 1 VLAN and separate traffic accordingly. 
Instead of data going from one host to another, the frames with a VLAN tag can be distributed from one host to many other hosts, that are connected to a port - depending on their configuration. 
The tags decide which packets should be sent to specific VLANs on the other side.

* Stronger security - identifyer tags
* Less congestion - preconfiguring traffic directions
* Visibility - Easier to understand and see issues
```
Adding the configurations to Switch A:\

Doing the same for Switch B, but making sure to tag and untag the correct ports, making the current version of the network diagram:\

# Wireshark box:

## Capturing network data on LAN 1

I clone another lubuntu box and name it Lubuntu Wireshark. I set its adapter 1 to Internal Network and LAN 1 - as I want to initially listen to that connection. \'
Booting up the box and starting wireshark, then doing a ping from Lubuntu 1(which is on LAN1) to Lubuntu 2, and also pinging Lubuntu 1 from Lubuntu 2. From the wireshark scan I see both requests and replies. 
\
I stop the recording and save it locally on the Lubuntu Wireshark-box:\
![](/documentation/E02/FirstCaptureSaveLocation.png)

Continuing by opening the capture and chosing a frame to have a closer look:
![](/documentation/E02/ChosenFrame.png)
From the information visible in the main screen of Wireshark before selecting the frame I do see its a ping request from Lubuntu 1 to Lubuntu 2

Selecting the frame gives further detailed information. 

Looking through- the IP address both from the source and destination is seen from the main window, but also in the initial part of the payload area:
![](/documentation/E02/FrameInfo1.png)\
The EthType is also marked with a red square, IPv4 (0x0800) which gives receiving and transmitting party the information of what the frame contains.

The source IP is marked on the picture with a red square connected with a red line. The source MAC-address is also marked with a red square, and it can be seen as the same as within the network settings of Lubuntu 1:  
![](/documentation/E02/Lubuntu1Mac.png)

Finally trying to identify the frames payload, which I understand as the data that is being carried by the frame. From what I can find it contains the OSI models Layer 3 header(IP) Layer 4 header (TCP) and the application data:

## Changes on Network_Switch_A


Configuring Network_Switch_A with an IP and allowing ssh-connections:\
![](/documentation/E02/SwitchSetIPAllowSSH.png)

\
From Lubuntu 2 I SSH into Network_Switch_A, and do show configuration, results shown in the quote below the screenshot:

## Changes on Network_Switch_B

It is though not clear to me which devices are refered to in the final part of the questioning ("from both devices"). I assume you mean to do the same on the other switch.
Doing the exact same operations on Network_Switch_B, just chosing a different IP, and then logging on to the switch with the Lubuntu 1 box.\
