# WLAN Home Network Analysis

## What can we see using the operating system Windows 10?

From the lower right menu the wireless local area networks in range of my laptop are listed. Without being connected to one, there is not too much information to be gained by using the standard OS information lookup tools.

As seen it is connected to the network called "DNA-WIFI-48D4". \
*On a sitenote: We have not changed anything within our home wireless network, besides putting a more secure password. The names and settings are set by the operator DNA. Some settings, like the public IP, will be anonymised*

**Disclaimer:** For the purpose of this section, I will be using a laptop and not the stationary machine hosting the VMs used so far in the project. 

## WiFi Analyzer

This is a program in the windows application store, made by Matt Hafner. It is used to see the channels of WiFi networks in our surrounding areas, troubleshoot WiFi problems and the best locations for our routers or access points. 
The tool will be used to go through the networks in the building I reside in. 


Loading up the application will immidiately show alot more information than we initially saw in the list.

In the top we see the dBm, which lists how powerful the signal strenght and how well I am connected to my WiFi network. 
Further down we see the name of the wireless (SSID) which channel it is currently using and also the frequency my wireless adapter is operating on, and how its connected to the wireless network. 

We can see the bandwidth and protocol. The protocol is important to see another important point. It shows if its a b,a, g, n, or ax and so on. This matters, as it identifies and determines how well I am connected 
to the wireless network.

As we continue down the list it shows our private IPv6 address within our home network, as well as our IPv4 public address from the router and to the internet. 
Also shown is the authentication type and encryption, as well as network uptime.

If we change view to "Networks" we see our current connected network on the top, and other networks in range in a list below, where I can see the other networks SSIDs, channel, signal strenght and if they are in or out of range.

Comparing this with the output of the command ipconfig /all and sectioning out the Wifi:

Interestingly, we see the specifications of the network card, which seems to have a later capacity than we saw in the WiFi Analyzer screen (802.11ax vs 802.11n). The differences from these I read to be Wi-Fi4 and Wi-Fi6, so perhabs there are some upgrades avaliable that I need to identify, or maybe it requires both depending on the connection. 
We see the public and private ip-addresses matches and information about the gateway (.1.1 - the routers private address). There are several temporary addresses, which from my understand is made by services of Windows for security reasons when performing certain tasks, as they do not want to share the preferred address. 


## Channel usage

From the top view of the application we can also go into the analyze section, where the channels are visualized. 

### 2.4 GHz

As we see from the picture below, we have our wireless marked with the wifi-symbol and set on Channel 1. We see two other networks on the same channel, and several others on channel 6 and 11.

2.4 Channels overlap. Each channel is 20 MHz wide, but the center of the channel is where it is marked and it is only separated by 5 MHz. So if we look at Channel 1 and 2, we see that they overlap by 75%. The only channels that do not overlap is Channel 1, 6 and 11. 

As we see in the picture above, this is most likely accounted for by the router software in the building. It seems most residents are using DNA routers judging by the SSIDs. Most networks seem to want to stay on those frequencies that overlap the least.

Doing some digging on this part gives a visualization that I wanted to add in the project:

If they're overlapping, they still take turns provided they're both relatively loud to each other (-75db or above after filtering). They can't talk to each other, but they can hear each other as noise. The Wi-Fi protocols won't allow you to start transmitting if they can hear enough noise. 
It has to do that, because it has to interwork with other protocols like Bluetooth. Also that's how it works with overlapping Wi-Fi channels too for example mixtures of 20/40/80 MHz, they can't talk to each other, but they can hear it as noise. 

Also if the channels overlap, but are sufficiently distant from each other, Wi-Fi is allowed to transmit because interchannel interference will be low. 
But co-channel interference, even at very great distance causes the transmitters to take turns. 
You prefer not to take turns if you can. So at big enough physical distance, you would prefer to not use 1,6,11 or 1,5,9,13 if others are, and you may do so without causing anyone any interference.
