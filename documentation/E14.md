# WLAN Home Network Analysis

## What can we see using the operating system Windows 10?

From the lower right menu the wireless local area networks in range of my laptop are listed. Without being connected to one, there is not too much information to be gained by using the standard OS information lookup tools.

As seen it is connected to the network called "DNA-WIFI-48D4". \
*On a sitenote: We have not changed anything within our home wireless network, besides putting a more secure password. The names and settings are set by the operator DNA. Some settings, like the public IP, will be anonymised*

For the purpose of this section, I will be using a laptop and not the stationary machine hosting the VMs used so far in the project.
