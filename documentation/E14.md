# WLAN Home Network Analysis

## What can we see using the operating system Windows 10?

From the lower right menu the wireless local area networks in range of my laptop are listed. Without being connected to one, there is not too much information to be gained by using the standard OS information lookup tools.

As seen it is connected to the network called "DNA-WIFI-48D4". \
*On a sitenote: We have not changed anything within our home wireless network, besides putting a more secure password. The names and settings are set by the operator DNA. Some settings, like the public IP, will be anonymised*

**Disclaimer:** For the purpose of this section, I will be using a laptop and not the stationary machine hosting the VMs used so far in the project. 

## WiFi Analyzer

This is a program in the windows application store, made by Matt Hafner. It is used to see the channels of WiFi networks in our surrounding areas, troubleshoot WiFi problems and the best locations for our routers or access points. 
The tool will be used to go through the networks in the building I reside in. 


Loading up the application will immidiately show alot more information than we initially saw in the list.

In the top we see the dBm, which lists how powerful the signal strenght and how well I am connected to my WiFi network. 
Further down we see the name of the wireless (SSID) which channel it is currently using and also the frequency my wireless adapter is operating on, and how its connected to the wireless network. 

We can see the bandwidth and protocol. The protocol is important to see another important point. It shows if its a b,a, g, n, or ax and so on. This matters, as it identifies and determines how well I am connected 
to the wireless network.
