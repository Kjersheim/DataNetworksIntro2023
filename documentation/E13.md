# Configuring Apache for Distributing Resources

## Plan

- [ ] Enable & Test Apache Webserver
- [ ] Update configuration files with E13 changes

# Verify lubuntu-apache instance

Using Lubuntu1, checking the webserver service and downloading the index-file found on the localhost address:

>![](/documentation/E13/testinglocalhost.gif)

Adding a new website as the webserver page:

>![](/documentation/E13/copywebtech.png)

Changing permissions so anyone can access and read the files. I do a test from Lubuntu3, connecting to the ip of Lubuntu1 http://192.168.39.5/

# Sniffing the traffic to and from the webserver

As shown in the picture below, I add a lubuntu with wireshark in place:

Continuing, I boot up the wireshark and start capturing packets. As it is capturing, I open the browser on Lubuntu3 and write the address to Lubuntu1, as before.

As seen in the **GIF** below, we see the result as several packages between .5 and .135.

While the client requests with GET, and we can see information about the source, host and also the user-agent. The user-agent simply describes which software or user information the website might want/need to adapt the content to best suit that type of user. Having an OSINT-background, I could not resist changing the user-agent as that is such a simple procedure. As we see int he gif, the new agent shows immidiately.

While the server responds with the content
