**Part 2:**

Despite not having a connection to the internet, there are still applications and functions on the virtual machine, like an ordinary computer. 
You can have a local connection to your host machine and transfer files, or via an usb-drive.

Alternatively, you can use the VM to test different programs or functions, or in a safe isolated enviroment learn or test these without doing harm to your host/other files, locations and machines. 

Lastly you can crack nazi-codes, or try to test if machines can think. Whichever action that does not require a connection to another computer.


**Part 3:**

Using ping to check if I can get a response from www.jamk.fi:

```

I feel I have somewhat of an understanding of how the networks are connected to eachother, though it is curious how much longer traceroute takes than ping. Trying to
resolve these questions by google makes me find that its a common question. From the answers I find the most descriptive would
be that the traceroute program sends a series of separate packets to the target, and deliberately is trying
to get a timeout error, hence it starts with a TTL of 1 - which I found to be time to live, and increase this and waiting for a timeout every time.

I want to make a 2nd VM on my laptop to do some testing later on, to double check connections and the systems and if these affect the result. 

**Part 5:**
\
mtr www.jamk.fi:\

\
mtr -n www.jamk.fi:\
![](/documentation/E01/Screenshot3MtrNJamk.png)
\
One "intersection" of the route had a massive packetloss, ranging between 50-80%. 
Not really understanding this, but trying pathping in windows both on a laptop on the same wifi - and on the stationary machine that hosts the VM.\

pathping stationary host:\
![](/documentation/E01/Screenshot4PathpingStationaryHost.png)
\
pathping laptop:\
![](/documentation/E01/Screenshot5PathpingLaptop.jpeg)
\

From doing similar searches with pathping -n I find several locations where packetloss is high. From what I understand use of asterix "*"
means packetloss. I need to go through more of the material and search for an answer to this. 

Looking at the results of pathping on both my stationary and my laptop I feel I can see how the ping moves from my machines, to my router, and then down the hatch to my ISPs servers. \
Furthermore to something described by ripe.net as owned by "Finnish Communication and Internet Exchange - FICIX ry". Finnish internet exchange points, as described in the materials.
Lastly I find two servers where upcloud seems to be the owner, and a quick google search
can indicate that the Helsinki company is hosting the webpages of jamk.fi.
