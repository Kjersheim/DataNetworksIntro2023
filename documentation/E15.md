# Configuring Basic DNS Functionality

# Plan 

- [ ] Test and document dig towards a labranet address
	- [ ] Capture packets and analyze

- [ ] Create a local DNS list in /etc/hosts
	- [ ] Testing, verifying and documenting



# Capturing DNS Data 

From the previously discussed topologies I want to do some testing from one VM to the internet. On the Lubuntu1 I change its interface from internal network to a bridge to the hostmachine.
This so it gets access to the internet isntead of the virtual network I have created. I proceed to start up Wireshark on the VM.

To avoid getting an abundance of information, I do some reconnaissance.

I proceed on setting the capture to port 53, which will capture any UDP or TCP packets coming through port 53.

I set wireshark to capture, and do a dig+trace to student.labranet.jamk.fi.
