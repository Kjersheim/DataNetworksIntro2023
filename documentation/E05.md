# Documentation for E05

## Plan
- [ ] Add additional lubuntu and router VM
- [ ] Plan addresses and update charts, logical and physical
- [ ] Configure RouterB
- [ ] Configure Lubuntu3
- [ ] Change ip configuration to DHCP on all lubuntus
- [ ] Topology charts
	- [ ] Physical
	- [ ] Logical


## Chosing subnets
From E03, chosing the subnets used for the new devices in the network:


$`\textcolor{limegreen}{ \text{192.168.39.128/26 - 62 avaliable host-addresses subnet - between Lubuntu3 and RouterB}\  } `$
$`\textcolor{navyblue}{ \text{10.8.83.240/30 - 2 avaliable host-addresses subnet - between RouterA and RouterB}\  } `$


### Physical topology draft

### Logical topology draft

At this point I have now made additions in both charts, and cloned a new lubuntu machine and a new router - both with new MAC-addresses.

- [x] Add additional lubuntu and router VM
- [x] Plan addresses and update charts, logical and physical

# Configuring new devices

## Vyos Router A and B

After the routers first boot up I initially change its name to vyos-router-b. 
 
At the same time I also change the other router that was named vyos-router-1 to vyos-router-a - for similar naming convention.

On router A I added a new adapter during the setup, which I linked to the new internal network named "RoToRo", adapter 2. Checking configurations on the router shows that this new adapter has gotten the eth1  interface.
