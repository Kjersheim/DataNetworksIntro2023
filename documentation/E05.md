## Chosing subnets

From E03, chosing the subnets used for the new devices in the network:


$`\textcolor{limegreen}{ \text{192.168.39.128/26 - 62 avaliable host-addresses subnet - between Lubuntu3 and RouterB}\  } `$
$`\textcolor{navyblue}{ \text{10.8.83.240/30 - 2 avaliable host-addresses subnet - between RouterA and RouterB}\  } `$


### Physical topology draft

![](/documentation/E05/CutoutNewAdditionsPhysical.png)


### Logical topology draft

![](/documentation/E05/CutoutNewAdditionsLogical.png)


At this point I have now made additions in both charts, and cloned a new lubuntu machine and a new router - both with new MAC-addresses.

- [x] Add additional lubuntu and router VM
- [x] Plan addresses and update charts, logical and physical



# Configuring new devices

After the routers first boot up I initially change its name to vyos-router-b. 
 
At the same time I also change the other router that was named vyos-router-1 to vyos-router-a - for similar naming convention.


## Vyos Router A

![](/documentation/E05/RouterNameChange.png)

On router A I added a new adapter during the setup, which I linked to the new internal network named "RoToRo", adapter 2. Checking configurations on the router shows that this new adapter has gotten the eth1 interface. This corresponds with the VM settings of newly added adapter. 

![](/documentation/E05/RouterAeth1.png)![](/documentation/E05/RouterASettingsNewAdapter.png)


Initially I debate if I needed to somehow connect the new router to an existing or new VLAN. Though as the material state, its such a minimal net and we will not fit other devices within this subnet, so its a router to router subnet where I dont need to add a separate VLAN. Deleting the question of new VLAN from my physical topology draft. 
Giving the new interface on router A an ip address:

![](/documentation/E05/RouterAeth1Address.png)


## Vyos Router B

showing interfaces on Vyos Router B:

![](/documentation/E05/RouterBInterfaces.png)

Comparing that to the adapter settings to distinquish which interface goes where.

![](/documentation/E05/RouterBAdapter1.png) | ![](/documentation/E05/RouterBAdapter2.png)

With this information I update the physical topology with interface and MAC addresses, and also add the interfaces to the logical topology. I do notice that for some reason my first router uses interfaces eth0 and eth1, while the second router uses interfaces eth1 and eth2. At this point Im not quite sure why, as so far the setup have been the same. 

![](/documentation/E05/InconsistentInterfacesRouters.png)

Based on the updated logical topology I add the addresses manually to Vyos Router B:

![](/documentation/E05/RouterBeth1_2_ip.png)

Which can be more easier visualized by:

![](/documentation/E05/CurrentLogicalCutout2.png)

As a test at this stage, I ping the routers from eachother, successfully:

## Lubuntu3

Initially I change the IP settings from the cloned Lubuntu1 to its own, according to the Logical topology chart. 

![](/documentation/E05/Lubuntu3Newaddress.png)

![](/documentation/E05/Lubuntu3Ipaddr.png)

After refreshing the connection, I check the address in the terminal. According to this both the IP is updated as well as lubuntus adapter1 MAC-address is corresponding the physical topology.

![](/documentation/E05/Lubuntu3PhysicalMac.png)

Testing connections by pinging Vyos Router B on .129 from Lubuntu3 on .130:

- [x] Configure Lubuntu3



# Directing the traffic that will pass through the routers


## Symmetric routing between Router A and B.

Starting by adding a route from Vyos Router B to the subnet 192.168.39.64/26 - where Lubuntu2 is a part of the subnet. 
Which, from what I understand, tells the Router B if it wants to send something to that subnet it needs to go by Router As interface eth1.

![](/documentation/E05/StaticRouteRouterBLubuntu2.png)

Second I also want to add a similar route the opposite way, where I guess the term "symmetric" comes from. 

Setting up a route from Vyos Router A to the subnet 192.168.39.128/26, the new subnet where Lubuntu3 is located., telling it to send traffic in that direction through Router Bs interface eth1.

![](/documentation/E05/StaticRouteRouterALubuntu3.png)

To test this connection I perform a ping from Lubuntu3 towards Lubuntu2:

![](/documentation/E05/PingLubuntu2FromLubuntu3.png)

And a traceroute:

![](/documentation/E05/TracerouteLubuntu3toLubuntu2.png)


## Routing to the other subnets

I proceed on adding a route also between Router B to the two other subnets connected to router A. While doing so I set up a ping between Lubuntu1 and Lubuntu3. It does not work initially, but once the route is set it starts reaching its destination.

- [x] Configure routers routing table



# Set up routers to be DHCP servers


## Vyos Router B

```
The avaliable IP range within the subnet 192.168.39.128/26 ranges from 130 to 190, 
with 191 as the last and reserved address in the subnet as a broadcast address. 
From my understanding then I would add the start from 130 and the stop to 190. However to follow the material
I will make it a bit shorter as we dont need that many devices in this subnet. 

set service dhcp-server shared-network-name lubuntu3 subnet 192.168.39.128/26 default-router 192.168.39.129

set service dhcp-server shared-network-name lubuntu3 subnet 192.168.39.128/26 range PCs start 192.168.39.135

set service dhcp-server shared-network-name lubuntu3 subnet 192.168.39.128/26 range PCs stop 192.168.39.155
```
I realize its a lot of text and you cant easily copy or paste directly in the Vyos. Using SSH from one of the lubuntus into Router B so I am able to paste the commands.

![](/documentation/E05/RouterB_DHCP.png)

Logging back on the Router B and checking configurations, we now have this section added under services:

![](/documentation/E05/RouterBServiceconfig.png)


## Vyos Router A

Similarily for router A we need to add the gateway and start+stop for the remaining 2 subnets (we are not adding DHCP functionality for the network_devices. 

I assume we want them to have static addresses as we still have several points in our configurations that is directed to them. 

Same method, SSH from a lubuntu machine into Vyos Router A and copy-pasting the commands I specified below here.
```
Adding 20 addresses for DHCP in subnet .0 - .63
set service dhcp-server shared-network-name lubuntu1 subnet 192.168.39.0/26 default-router 192.168.39.1

set service dhcp-server shared-network-name lubuntu1 subnet 192.168.39.0/26 range PCs start 192.168.39.5

set service dhcp-server shared-network-name lubuntu1 subnet 192.168.39.0/26 range PCs stop 192.168.39.25
```

```
Adding 20 addresses for DHCP in subnet .64 - .127
set service dhcp-server shared-network-name lubuntu2 subnet 192.168.39.64/26 default-router 192.168.39.65

set service dhcp-server shared-network-name lubuntu2 subnet 192.168.39.64/26 range PCs start 192.168.39.70

set service dhcp-server shared-network-name lubuntu2 subnet 192.168.39.64/26 range PCs stop 192.168.39.90
```

After having them added I check over the numbers with show | compare. After that I make sure to commit and save, before logging out of the SSH session.

Checking services to make sure it was saved:

- [x] Configure routers to be DHCP servers

Finishing up the routers as there is nothing more that is requested to be done with them in this exercise:

- [x] Configure Router A and B
	- [x] Initial setup
	- [x] Interfaces and addresses
	- [x] Checking gateways and remaining configurations



# Lubuntu IPv4 settings

Untill now the Lubuntu VMs have all had a static IP. To test the DHCP function in the routers I go into all 3 Lubuntus and change the IP settings from manual to Automatic (DHCP) and making sure to delete the remnants of the old manual set IP. 

![](/documentation/E05/Lubuntu1DHCPWorking.png)

Changing as described and it got a new IP address which was the first within the start-stop range I defined in Router A for Lubuntu1s subnet.


Doing the same change to Lubuntu2 and Lubuntu3, with the result:

- [x] Change ip configuration to DHCP on all lubuntus

# Topology charts

Throughout the exercise I have tried to update and keep adding information as I work and change configurations. The results of the topology charts are posted below. There are still parts I feel is missing, like tagging and untagging of lines between the routers, or adding VLAN in case we have more need for that for example with lubuntu3. However as the exercise have not discussed this, I did not add them on my own initiative to try to keep it as clean and exercise bare necessities.
