## From home to the internet

"iperf" is a command-line tool that is used in diagnosing network speed issues. It does this by measuring the maximum network traffick - back and forth - that a server can handle. It is particularily handy to use when you are having
network speed issues, as it can identify parts of the network where an problem might be located. 

After changing the network settings on one of my lubuntu machines I can test the iperf command as seen below.

This first setting is using iperf in client mode, connecting to the address iperf.he.net,
and as we can see from the output it shows three columns time interval, transfer amount and bandwidth. 

Changing the time to only 5 seconds, but still using the default port of 5001:

Changing the program to use UDP instead of TCP:

While TCP uses slow start, which is an algorithm which balances the speed of the network connection, to maximize bandwidth and minimize lost segments. By that it adapts to the slowest part of the network, and waits for the acks to come back. UDP leaves it to the 
application layer and does not wait for the acks. When specified, we can list what bandwidth we want to use with the -b / --bandwidth added to the command, and it runs even if too high - though with a considerable loss of datagrams.

```
From a discussion on Stack Exchange I find a decription to say that TCP segment is the protocol data unit which consists a TCP header and an application data piece (packet) which comes from the (upper) Application Layer. Transport layer data is generally named as a segment, 
and network layer data unit is named as a datagram, but when we use UDP as transport layer protocol we dont say UDP segment, but UDP datagram. This can be because we do not segmentate UDP data unit, but segmentation is made in the transport layer when we use TCP. 

Furthermore, I find that a TCP connection is a stream of bytes. The packetizing is done by the TCP/IP stack in the operating system. On the other hand, UDP is not a stream - its just a bunch of datagrams, that are not guaranteed to arrive in any order or arrive at all. Any protocol
implemented with UDP has to handle these details in their own application-specific way.

```

I chose a different public iperf server, actually located in Liev in Ukraine:

First TCP to the listed address on port 5201 and time set to 15 seconds. After that doing the same settings but using UDP.

Lastly I do a new test, where I notice that if I do not specify the 5201 port the connection is refused. In addition to that, UDP seems to be refused aswell. Maybe the given address only listens to a certain port, or the other ports somehow are busy. 
From what I understand these public servers can still only handle one request/iperf per port from users around the world at the time. 

I did initially try the bandwidth option on UDP but chose to wait with this till I can set up a server and client within my own network.

## Testing iperf within my own network

I undo the changes and keep Lubuntu1 away from the internet again, back in the comfort of the home network. I boot up Lubuntu2 as well and verify the connection between these two machines.
