## From home to the internet

"iperf" is a command-line tool that is used in diagnosing network speed issues. It does this by measuring the maximum network traffick - back and forth - that a server can handle. It is particularily handy to use when you are having
network speed issues, as it can identify parts of the network where an problem might be located. 

After changing the network settings on one of my lubuntu machines I can test the iperf command as seen below.
