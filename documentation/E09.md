# Documentation for E09

# Network segmentation and firewalls

## Plan


- [ ]  Prepare the topology
	- [ ] Update Physical schematic
	- [ ] Update Logical schematic
	- [ ] Add DHCP server on Router C to distribute addresses to the new public subnet 
	- [ ] Add new topology to the dynamic routing 

- [ ] Configure firewall settings to Router C
		- [ ] Add and visualize 3 policy areas

# Preparing changes in topology

To prepare the added WAN and use of Router C as a firewall, I create an additional interface with this purpose.

# Notes

> perimeter defence around network segments

Filtering decisions within a firewall are typically installed in a 'firewall rule table'

Network segments typically means a sub/supernet. 'Policy' zones can contain several subnets within the zone, where all sub/supernets can share a policy.

Create an array - of a group/several subnets that can belong to the same cathegory of policies. "Categorization of network segments".
> Whitelist devices and groups that should have access, and deny anything else. 


**Stateful** Firewalls: 
The state table is a dynamic rule table, that reflects accepter traffics both directions. If something is accepted out, it is also accepted in.  Bidirectional.

**Stateless** need to both accept in AND out. Unidirectional.


>High availability (HA) allows you to place two firewalls in a group and synchronize their configuration. This prevents a single point of failure on your network. The two firewalls have a heartbeat connection, which ensures failover if one of the firewalls goes down
If firewalls are connected as such they might need a "heartbeat" cable to ensure syncronization of data.
