# Making the network public

# Plan

- [ ] Investigate and document home networks IPv4 address range
- [ ] Add info and update topology charts

- [ ] Router3 
	- [ ] Configurate interface to bridge to the internet
	- [ ] Verify DNS configurations
	- [ ] Add a default route from the router to the internet

- [ ] Update DHCP servers

- [ ] Verification and connectivity

- [ ] Update configuration files with E17 changes

# Current home network

## Private

Bridging the Lubuntu Wireshark machine to the hostmachine for a brief check of the private network.

The gateway aka the private address to the router in my home network is as follows:

Checking if other devices are connected:

Asking for a bit more detail, I search for any devices with web-related ports open. On a sidenote, could be an interesting way to for example check for security issues within my network when ports are not supposed to be open.

Lastly, adding the interfaces on the router:

## Public

The first step I take is to go to www.ripe.net and check which address my router is using to be in contact with the internet. The following shows the range, although I have censored out the last octet for privacy reasons.

A quick query for the address gives the following information. Noted in the category origin, we find an autonomous system 
registred on the ISP DNA.

## AS16086 - DNA

From the IP search initially I find information about the DNA AS I am connected to. Some information tells me what kind of services the
AS provides, for example a network described as "eyeball" which I find is a slang to categorise access networks whose primary users use the network to "look at things"..

In addition to that there is a range of prefixes, other supernets, from which I understand is within the control of the AS in question, as well as a range of neighbours and other AS.

## AS16086 IPv4 Route Propagation

*Source: https://bgp.he.net/AS16086*

Looking into the map above, we find the AS174 as a system within Arin in North-America by Cogent Communications, AS2119 a Norwegian ISP Telenor, AS3356 by Lumen and located mostly in Northern America but also other regions of the world.

# Configuration changes in Vyos Router 3

Initially I power off the Vyos Router 3 to change its Adapter 3 to bridged interface. Once that is done, I remove the old public WAN address starting with 43, as well as the IPv6 address I added in E16. The bridged interface is registred to be
set to the previously chosen interface that have the NAT configuration as outbound interface. 



- [ ] Router3 
	- [ ] Configurate interface to bridge to the internet
	- [ ] Verify DNS configurations
	- [ ] Add a default route from the router to the internet
