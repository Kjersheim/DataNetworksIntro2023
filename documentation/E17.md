# Making the network public

# Plan

- [ ] Investigate and document home networks IPv4 address range
- [ ] Add info and update topology charts

- [ ] Router3 
	- [ ] Configurate interface to bridge to the internet
	- [ ] Verify DNS configurations
	- [ ] Add a default route from the router to the internet

- [ ] Update DHCP servers

- [ ] Verification and connectivity

- [ ] Update configuration files with E17 changes

# Current home network

The first step I take is to go to www.ripe.net and check which address my router is using to be in contact with the internet. The following shows the range, although I have censored out the last octet for privacy reasons.

A quick query for the address gives the following information. Noted in the category origin, we find an autonomous system 
registred on the ISP DNA.

## AS16086 - DNA

From the IP search initially I find information about the DNA AS I am connected to. Some information tells me what kind of services the
AS provides, for example a network described as "eyeball" which I find is a slang to categorise access networks whose primary users use the network to "look at things"..

In addition to that there is a range of prefixes, other supernets, from which I understand is within the control of the AS in question, as well as a range of neighbours and other AS.
