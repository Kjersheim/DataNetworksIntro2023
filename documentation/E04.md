## Plan
- [ ] Add router VM
- [ ] Topology charts
	- [ ] Physical
	- [ ] Logical
- [ ] Configure switches
	- [ ] Switch A
	- [ ] Switch B
	- [ ] Management/Network devices VLAN done separately
- [ ] Configure router
- [ ] Configure Lubuntu1 and 2


**Starting the exercise with importing the router-image as a new VM, named Vyos 1.**

Adding a network adapter, nr. 4, to Network_Switch_B, and setting it to an internal network I named RoTOSw (Router to Switch, as used in the material as it seems like a descriptive way of naming it).

Making sure to keep the chart with the physical topology updated, making a cutout of the newly added router: \

- [x] Add router VM


## Addresses to use
Going through my Exercise 2 and 3 networks and chosing two 50(well 62, 64-2) /26 subnets and a 13 (14, 16-2) /28 subnet. 

![](/documentation/E04/ChosingSubnets.png)
```
The addresses I will use:
192.168.39.0/26
192.168.39.64/26

10.08.83.0/28
```

Before starting to do changes - I need to do some planning. I make a backup of the physical topology and in addition to that create a duplicate so I can start working on a logical topology. 
Based on the OSI model and as described in the material I make the physical topology valid for the datalink and physical layer in the OSI model - and will try to create a logical topology for the datalink and network layer.

*Adding a cutout of the model as its nice to see later on in the course, copied from my old digital forensic litterature, so referencing Associate Professor Fergus Toolan, 2020)*


The main focus at this point is to update and divide the layers on each topology chart, the physical and the logical. I also add information about a new VLAN that I want to use for the Lubuntu-VMs, in addition to the previously created "workstations". 

At this point my plan for the network and working initially on the Logical Topology is like the draft below:
![](/documentation/E04/LogicalChart_1.png) 

I am yet to add and plan IP addresses for the router, as I have not at this point started it at all. From what I understand, or assume, from the drawing is that the router needs a connection to all 3 networks. 
To do this, I further assume we need 3 adapters/network cards with ports dedicated to each of the 3 networks. In this way, the router will actually in total have 3 IP addresses. Ill be interested 


# Implementing configurations, from both physical and logical topology

## Configuring Switches

- I add the VLAN "secretbasement" with tag 15 to both Switch A and B. VLAN workstation is previously saved on both switches with tag 5.  
- From Network_Switch_B I tag port 3 for both VLAN workstations and secretbasement, as this is the connection to the Vyos 1 Router
- Then, on the Network_Switch_B, I untag port 2 which goes from Network_Switch_B to Lubuntu 2. 
- On Network_Switch_A, I keep port 1 untagged, as that goes to Lubuntu 1. 
- Next on Network_Switch_A, I keep port 2 for VLAN workstations tagged, as well as tagging port 2 for VLAN secretbasement.

## Configuring Router
```
Note to self: Danger! Always use poweroff -command with the Vyos the virtual machine!
```

Trying to find information about the adapters:

![](/documentation/E04/vyosadapter1mac.png) 

Which corresponds with :

![](/documentation/E04/VyosSettingsAdapter1Mac.png) 

Adding a description and looking around for the information above to further test the commands of the router. Then setting the IP addresses  for the router in the two subnets which will be in connection with lubuntu1 and 2. 

![](/documentation/E04/Vyos1configuration_1.png) 

- [x] Configure router



## Configuring Lubuntu-machines

Booting up Lubuntu1 and Lubuntu2 to update the new IP address and setting the gateway address from each Lubuntu to the corresponding subnet ip the router has for each vlan. 
Testing the new configurations by reconnecting to update the network, then checking the ip address and subnet mask which hopefully are updated. Lastly trying to ping the router.

### Lubuntu 1
![](/documentation/E04/Lubuntu1Config_1.png) 

IP address and mask was updated, and other addresses like the broadcast is also visible. Pinging the router by its VLAN "workstations" IP address:

![](/documentation/E04/Lubuntu1_Config_ping.png) 

Successful ping. 

### Lubuntu 2
IP address and mask was updated. Pinging the router by its VLAN "secretbasement" IP address:

![](/documentation/E04/Lubuntu2Config.png) 

Great Success <sub>*(with Borat voice)*</sub>
- [x] Configure Lubuntu1 and 2



# Management VLAN

I create a new vlan "network_devices" on both switches, and tag the ports between the switches as well as the router for that new vlan.
After that, i remove the previously added IP address that I did with testing in E02, before adding the new address and mask to each switch according to my chart over the logical topology.

Showing configuration, and remembering to save. 
![](/documentation/E04/SwitchA_B_networkdevicesconfig.png) 

At this point I met some issues adding the vlan tag 25 network_devices to the router. After troubleshooting I decided to delete the router, and make a new one. 

New information is as follows, and updated on the charts:

Name: Vyos Router A

MAC-address: 08002793E377

Configuring the new router in the same way as above - making sure to follow the instructions as I suspect doing something wrong previously.
Adding first the two addresses for VLANs workstations and secretbasement, tag 5 and 15. Committing and saving, before poweroff and starting the router again to see how it shows.

 ![](/documentation/E04/NewRouterInterfaces.png) 

Then I try again, to add the third vlan tag 25 (network_devices), with the address 10.8.83.3/28.
With much anticipation - it is successfully added. 

And ok here I had 1 hour of further troubleshooting. Everything was set up right, according to the physical and logical topology chart. No ping getting through. After quadruple-checking every port, interface, gateway and address I find that the Adapter 1 from the vyos router was pointing to LAN1. It should be pointing to RoTOSw. Changing and rebooting the router.

# Updated Physical and Logical topology charts

## Physical topology chart at this stage:

# Connectivity tests

**Lubuntu <-> Lubuntu**

 ![](/documentation/E04/ConnectLubuntus.png) 
 
 Traceroute shows the request travelling through the router and to the other Lubuntu, and vice versa.

 **Lubuntu1 and 2 <-> Router**
 
 ![](/documentation/E04/Connect2LubuntusToRouter.png)

As also seen in the figure displaying traceroute between Lubuntus, the request goes straight from the Lubuntu-client to the router within its subnet.

 # Configuration files
 
 For some reason copying the configurations directly from the switches is not possible with the setup we are running. SSH from a lubuntu machine to copy:
