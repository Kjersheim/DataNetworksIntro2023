# Documentation for E04

**Starting the exercise with importing the router-image as a new VM, named Vyos 1.**

Adding a network adapter, nr. 4, to Network_Switch_B, and setting it to an internal network I named RoTOSw (Router to Switch, as used in the material as it seems like a descriptive way of naming it).

Making sure to keep the chart with the physical topology updated, making a cutout of the newly added router: \

Going through my Exercise 2 and 3 networks and chosing two 50(well 62, 64-2) /26 subnets and a 13 (14, 16-2) /28 subnet.

```
**The addresses I will use:** 
192.168.39.0/26
192.168.39.64/26

10.08.83.0/28
```

Before starting to do changes - I need to do some planning. I make a backup of the physical topology and in addition to that create a duplicate so I can start working on a logical topology. 
Based on the OSI model and as described in the material I make the physical topology valid for the datalink and physical layer in the OSI model - and will try to create a logical topology for the datalink and network layer.

*Adding a cutout of the model as its nice to see later on in the course, copied from my old digital forensic litterature, so referencing Associate Professor Fergus Toolan, 2020)*


The main focus at this point is to update and divide the layers on each topology chart, the physical and the logical. I also add information about a new VLAN that I want to use for the Lubuntu-VMs, in addition to the previously created "workstations". 

# Working on the Logical Topology

- I add the VLAN "secretbasement" with tag 15 to both Switch A and B.  \
- In addition to that I tag port 3 on Network_Switch_B, which is its connection to the Vyos 1 Router, as well as untagging port 2 which goes from Switch B to Lubuntu 2. \
