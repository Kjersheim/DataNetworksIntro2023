# Calculating Networks

### Exercise 1
```
192.168.39.0/24
```
*Address range:* 
192.168.39.0 **/24**  - 8 bits remaining, 2^8 = 256 possible addresses in the range 0 - 255. 

The 4 octet address divided in 3 octets for network-bits 'n' and 1 octet for host-bits 'h': \
$`\textcolor{blue}{ \text{nnnn nnnn . nnnn nnnn . nnnn nnnn}\  } `$ $`\textcolor{red}{ \text{. hhhh hhhh}\  } `$ \
$`\textcolor{blue}{ \text{network/subnet, 24 bits}\  } `$ $`\textcolor{red}{ \text{host/addresses, 8 bits}\  } `$


**Note:** The very first bit in the host address - the "subnet address", aka *0000 0000 or in decimal .0*, is reserved and not usable for devices in the network. \
The last bit in the host address, *1111 1111 / .255*, is the "broadcast address" and similarily also reserved and cannot be used for devices. \
Remaining amount of possible devices addresses is  then **254**.  
\
So to note the actual usable addresses range would be 192.168.39.1 to 192.168.39.254. 

*Broadcast address:*  \
192.168.39.255 - the last of the host addresses.

*Subnet address:* \
192.168.39.0 - the first of the host addresses.

### Exercise 2
```
10.08.83.0/24 
```
Similar as in Exercise 1, this address subnet mask *noted in slash format /24*,  indicates that we have the following division of subnet bits 'n' and host bits 'h': 

$`\textcolor{blue}{ \text{nnnn nnnn . nnnn nnnn . nnnn nnnn}\  } `$ $`\textcolor{red}{ \text{. hhhh hhhh}\  } `$ \
$`\textcolor{blue}{ \text{network/subnet, 24 bits}\  } `$ $`\textcolor{red}{ \text{host/addresses, 8 bits}\  } `$



The exercise asks to divide this net and create new subnets each consisting of a minimum of 50 addresses. 

Following the material and checking the power of 2 for the binary alternatives 2^8 originally gives 256 addresses like shown above. 
2^7 gives 128 addresses, 2^6 gives 64 addresses - which is the one we chose as the next option is too small. 

So 6 bits needs to be selected as the host-bits: \
$`\textcolor{blue}{ \text{nnnn nnnn . nnnn nnnn . nnnn nnnn. nn}\  } `$ $`\textcolor{red}{ \text{hh hhhh}\  } `$ \
$`\textcolor{blue}{ \text{network/subnet, 26 bits}\  } `$ $`\textcolor{red}{ \text{host/addresses, 6 bits}\  } `$

Subnet masking: \
Binary: $`\textcolor{blue}{ \text{1111 1111 . 1111 1111 . 1111 1111. 11}\  } `$ $`\textcolor{red}{ \text{00 0000}\  } `$ \
Decimal: $`\textcolor{limegreen}{ \text{255 . 255 . 255. 192}\  } `$

Going through the host bits gives the avaliable addresses to use in the new subnet:

hh hhhh\
00 0000 - subnet address(reserved)\
00 0001 - first usable address\
11 1110 - last usable address\
11 1111 - broadcast address(reserved)

This subnet is only using one fourth of the original 256 avaliable addresses, so we can create 3 more subnets with the same framework described above. To do this we "borrow" the 2 bits that we transfered to the subnet bits previously.\
ss | hh hhhh\
ss | 00 0000 - subnet address(reserved)\
ss | 00 0001 - first usable address\
ss | 11 1110 - last usable address\
ss | 11 1111 - broadcast address(reserved)\

Shere ss continuing will be 01, 10 and 11 for the next 3 subnets, filling out the avaliable 256 original addresses. 
The end results are 4 subnets with a total of 248 usable addresses. 
```
Initially I was quite confused with how to actually do this, as just dividing and adding new separate 
subnet addresses and broadcast addresses still didnt actually change the addresses much, besides reserving in this case 6 more addresses.
However - if I understand correctly, the subnet address function is to allow networks have multiple subnets within them.  

While trying to pinpoint some other questions I had, I spent a considerable time trying to figure out if each subnet would also need/have their own 
subnet-mask. At some point I started adding the network-bits i borrowed as host-bits for the 2nd, 3rd and 4th subnet - before realizing that if I did that, 
I would actually decrease the avaliable host-addresses and therefor considerably decrease amount of possible devices. 
I did realise there was a function or process called VLSM however not discussed in the current material. 
So for now I came to the conclusion that when doing subnetting, one new subnet mask is valid for all subnets.
