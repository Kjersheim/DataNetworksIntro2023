# Calculating Networks

### Exercise 1
```
192.168.39.0/24
```
*Address range:* 
192.168.39.0 **/24**  - 8 bits remaining, 2^8 = 256 possible addresses in the range 0 - 255. 

The 4 octet address divided in 3 octets for network-bits 'n' and 1 octet for host-bits 'h': \
$`\textcolor{blue}{ \text{nnnn nnnn . nnnn nnnn . nnnn nnnn}\  } `$ $`\textcolor{red}{ \text{. hhhh hhhh}\  } `$ \
$`\textcolor{blue}{ \text{network/subnet, 24 bits}\  } `$ $`\textcolor{red}{ \text{host/addresses, 8 bits}\  } `$


**Note:** The very first bit in the host address - the "subnet address", aka *0000 0000 or in decimal .0*, is reserved and not usable for devices in the network. \
The last bit in the host address, *1111 1111 / .255*, is the "broadcast address" and similarily also reserved and cannot be used for devices. \
Remaining amount of possible devices addresses is  then **254**.  
\
So to note the actual usable addresses range would be 192.168.39.1 to 192.168.39.254. 

*Broadcast address:*  \
192.168.39.255 - the last of the host addresses.

*Subnet address:* \
192.168.39.0 - the first of the host addresses.

### Exercise 2
```
192.168.39.0/24
```
Similar as in Exercise 1, this address subnet mask *noted in slash format /24*,  indicates that we have the following division of subnet bits 'n' and host bits 'h': 

$`\textcolor{blue}{ \text{nnnn nnnn . nnnn nnnn . nnnn nnnn}\  } `$ $`\textcolor{red}{ \text{. hhhh hhhh}\  } `$ \
$`\textcolor{blue}{ \text{network/subnet, 24 bits}\  } `$ $`\textcolor{red}{ \text{host/addresses, 8 bits}\  } `$



The exercise asks to divide this net and create new subnets each consisting of a minimum of 50 addresses. 

Following the material and checking the power of 2 for the binary alternatives 2^8 originally gives 256 addresses like shown above. 
2^7 gives 128 addresses, 2^6 gives 64 addresses - which is the one we chose as the next option is too small. 

So 6 bits needs to be selected as the host-bits: \
$`\textcolor{blue}{ \text{nnnn nnnn . nnnn nnnn . nnnn nnnn. nn}\  } `$ $`\textcolor{red}{ \text{hh hhhh}\  } `$ \
$`\textcolor{blue}{ \text{network/subnet, 26 bits}\  } `$ $`\textcolor{red}{ \text{host/addresses, 6 bits}\  } `$

Subnet masking: \
Binary: $`\textcolor{blue}{ \text{1111 1111 . 1111 1111 . 1111 1111. 11}\  } `$ $`\textcolor{red}{ \text{00 0000}\  } `$ \
Decimal: $`\textcolor{limegreen}{ \text{255 . 255 . 255. 192}\  } `$

Going through the host bits gives the avaliable addresses to use in the new subnet:

hh hhhh\
00 0000 - subnet address(reserved)\
00 0001 - first usable address\
11 1110 - last usable address\
11 1111 - broadcast address(reserved)

This subnet is only using one fourth of the original 256 avaliable addresses, so we can create 3 more subnets with the same framework described above. To do this we "borrow" the 2 bits that we transfered to the subnet bits previously.\
ss | hh hhhh\
ss | 00 0000 - subnet address(reserved)\
ss | 00 0001 - first usable address\
ss | 11 1110 - last usable address\
ss | 11 1111 - broadcast address(reserved)\

Shere ss continuing will be 01, 10 and 11 for the next 3 subnets, filling out the avaliable 256 original addresses. 
The end results are 4 subnets with a total of 248 usable addresses. 
```
Initially I was quite confused with how to actually do this, as just dividing and adding new separate 
subnet addresses and broadcast addresses still didnt actually change the addresses much, besides reserving in this case 6 more addresses.
However - if I understand correctly, the subnet address function is to allow networks have multiple subnets within them.  

While trying to pinpoint some other questions I had, I spent a considerable time trying to figure out if each subnet would also need/have their own 
subnet-mask. At some point I started adding the network-bits i borrowed as host-bits for the 2nd, 3rd and 4th subnet - before realizing that if I did that, 
I would actually decrease the avaliable host-addresses and therefor considerably decrease amount of possible devices. 
I did realise there was a process variable lenght subnet mask as briefly discuss, but I might not have caught the intended process as of yet.  
So for now I came to the conclusion that when doing subnetting, one new subnet mask is valid for all subnets.

### Exercise 3
```
10.08.83.0/24
```

Required hosts: 13
2^4 = 16, minus subnet address and broadcast reserved = 14. Not very fit for future scaling but chosing this based on the assignment. 

So 4 bits needs to be selected as the host-bits: \
$`\textcolor{blue}{ \text{nnnn nnnn . nnnn nnnn . nnnn nnnn. nnnn}\  } `$ $`\textcolor{red}{ \text{hhhh}\  } `$ \
$`\textcolor{blue}{ \text{network/subnet, 28 bits}\  } `$ $`\textcolor{red}{ \text{host/addresses, 4 bits}\  } `$

Subnet masking: \
Binary: $`\textcolor{blue}{ \text{1111 1111 . 1111 1111 . 1111 1111. 1111}\  } `$ $`\textcolor{red}{ \text{0000}\  } `$ \
Decimal: $`\textcolor{limegreen}{ \text{255 . 255 . 255. 240}\  } `$

This will give room for 16 subnets, each having room for 14 host addresses and in total for all subnets 224 host. (256-(16x2))

Similarily as the above Exercise 2, once the first set of 16 addresses are used for the first subnet, we will borrow a bit from the network-bits for the host-bits, 
turning 0000 0000 as the first bit in the first subnet to 1111 1111 as the last bit in the last subnet. 

1st subnet
ssss | hhhh\
0000 | 0000 - subnet address(reserved)\
0000 | 0001 - first usable address\
0000 | 1110 - last usable address\
0000 | 1111 - broadcast address(reserved)\

2nd subnet
ssss | hh hhhh
0001 | 0000 - subnet address(reserved)\
0001 | 0001 - first usable address\
0001 | 1110 - last usable address\
0001 | 1111 - broadcast address(reserved)\

and this will continue through 1111 - where the very last address in the last subnet will be \

### Exercise 4
```
10.08.83.240/28
```

Requirements for the subnets are a capacity of 2 usable addresses so 2 bits and 4 addresses would be a good fit. 2^2=4.

So 2 bits needs to be selected as the host-bits: \
$`\textcolor{blue}{ \text{nnnn nnnn . nnnn nnnn . nnnn nnnn. nnnn nn}\  } `$ $`\textcolor{red}{ \text{hh}\  } `$ \
$`\textcolor{blue}{ \text{network/subnet, 30 bits}\  } `$ $`\textcolor{red}{ \text{host/addresses, 2 bits}\  } `$

Subnet masking: \
Binary: $`\textcolor{blue}{ \text{1111 1111 . 1111 1111 . 1111 1111. 1111 11}\  } `$ $`\textcolor{red}{ \text{00}\  } `$ \
Decimal: $`\textcolor{limegreen}{ \text{255 . 255 . 255. 252}\  } `$

In binary the first 3.5 octets of the IP-address will be: 0000 1010 . 0000 1000 . 0101 0011 . 1111 *hhhh*
The last half octet added after the decimal IP-address in the table below, to show the borrowing of bits from network to host. 

| Specification | Subnet No. 1 | Subnet No. 2 | Subnet No. 3 | Subnet No. 4 |
| -----  | -----   | -----  | -----   | -----   |
| Network address  | 10.08.83.240/30 (0000)   | 10.08.83.244/30 (0100)   | 10.08.83.248/30 (1000)  | 10.08.83.252/30 (1100)  |
| Number of usable (host) addresses in the subnet | 2   | 2   | 2  | 2   |
| First IP Host address  | 10.08.83.241 (0001)   | 10.08.83.245 (0001)   | 10.08.83.249 (1001) | 10.08.83.253 (1101)  |
| Last IP Host address  | 10.08.83.242 (0010)   | 10.08.83.246 (0010)   | 10.08.83.250 (1010)  | 10.08.83.254 (1110)  |
| Broadcast address  | 10.08.83.243 (0011)  | 10.08.83.247 (0011)  | 10.08.83.251 (1011)   | 10.08.83.255 (1111)  |

### Exercise 5
```
is 10.08.83.0/24 a part of 10.08.16.0/20?
```

**10.08.16.0/20:** \
$`\textcolor{blue}{ \text{nnnn nnnn . nnnn nnnn . nnnn}\  } `$ $`\textcolor{red}{ \text{hhhh. hhhh hhhh}\  } `$ \
$`\textcolor{blue}{ \text{network/subnet, 20 bits}\  } `$ $`\textcolor{red}{ \text{host/addresses, 12 bits}\  } `$ \ 
2^12 bits on the host addresses gives 4096 - 2 = 4094 usable addresses. 

Sup/bnet masking: \
Binary: $`\textcolor{blue}{ \text{1111 1111 . 1111 1111 . 1111}\  } `$ $`\textcolor{red}{ \text{0000. 0000 0000}\  } `$ \
Decimal: $`\textcolor{limegreen}{ \text{255 . 255 . 240. 0}\  } `$

`On a sidenote:
255.255.255.255 - 255.255.240.0 = 15.255
`

| Description | Binary host-bits | Decimal host address |
| -----  | -----   | -----  |
Subnet address | 0000.0000 0000 | 0.0 |
Second address | 0000.0000 0001 | 0.1  |
Second last address | 1111.1111 1110 | 15.254 |
Broadcast/Last address | 1111.1111 1111 | **15.255** |

Or more specifically:

| Specification | Subnet No. 1 | 
| -----  | -----  |  
| Network address  | 10.08.16.0/20  | 
| Number of usable (host) addresses in the subnet | 4094   | 
| First IP Host address  | 10.08.16.1  | 
| Last IP Host address  | 10.08.31.254  | 
| Broadcast address  | 10.08.31.255  | 

By continuing this logic I would have the next supernets starting at 10.08.32.0, 10.08.48.0, 10.08.64.0, 10.08.80.0, 10.08.96.0 

So if I am looking at the initial asked address 10.08.83.0 would be within the 5th supernet of the size /20, starting from 10.08.80.0 and ending at 10.08.95.255. 

```
I believe I spent about 2.5 hours trying to not put needles through my head on this assignment, as I couldnt get a proper grip over what calculations were wanted. Hopefully I got some idea eventually.
```

To get a quick yes or no of the initial question, I could also compare the binaries of the /20 and /24 subnets. 

10.8.83.0/24  -  0000 1010 . 0000 1000 . 0101 0011 . 0000 0000 /24
10.8.16.0/20  -  0000 1010 . 0000 1000 . 0001 0000 . 0000 0000 /20

If comparing the initial 20 subnet bits:

![](/documentation/E03/CompareBinaries.png)

We get that it differs and its not within the supernet.


### Exercise 6
```
10.08.83.0/24 a part of supernet 10.0.0.0/8?
```

Trying to attack this similarily, finding the bit allocation and usable addresses:
$`\textcolor{blue}{ \text{nnnn nnnn . }\  } `$ $`\textcolor{red}{ \text{hhhh hhhh . hhhh hhhh. hhhh hhhh}\  } `$ \
$`\textcolor{blue}{ \text{network/subnet, 8 bits}\  } `$ $`\textcolor{red}{ \text{host/addresses, 24 bits}\  } `$ \ 
2^24 bits on the host addresses gives 16 777 216 - 2 = 16 million 777 thousand 214 usable addresses. 

Supernet masking: \
Binary: $`\textcolor{blue}{ \text{1111 1111 . }\  } `$ $`\textcolor{red}{ \text{0000 0000 . 0000 0000. 0000 0000}\  } `$ \
Decimal: $`\textcolor{limegreen}{ \text{255 . 0 . 0. 0}\  } `$

`Testing the sidenote I came across in last exercise: 
255.255.255.255 - 255.0.0.0 = 0.255.255.255 so quite a few options, and opposed to the last exercise this number, 16 million is so large it makes less sense as human readable.
`

Trying to set up the supernet in a table:
| Description | Binary host-bits | Decimal host address |
| -----  | -----   | -----  |
Subnet address | .0000 0000 . 0000 0000 . 0000 0000 | .0.0.0 |
Second address |.0000 0000 . 0000 0000 . 0000 0001 | .0.0.1  |
Second last address | .1111 1111 . 1111 1111 . 1111 1110 | .255.255.254 |
Broadcast/Last address | .1111 1111 . 1111 1111 . 1111 1111 | **.255.255.255** |

Or more specifically:

| Specification | Subnet No. 1 | 
| -----  | -----  |  
| Network address  | 10.0.0.0/8  | 
| Number of usable (host) addresses in the subnet | 16 777 214   | 
| First IP Host address  | 10.0.0.1  | 
| Last IP Host address  | 10.255.255.254  | 
| Broadcast address  | 10.255.255.255  | 

As mentioned these numbers are beginning to be so large its hard to fathom but - the supernet is indeed containing the address 10.08.83.0 (and everyting else within 10.0.0.0). 
I have a hard time figuring out what would be the next subnet, but there are a considerable amount of addresses still between 10 - 255 in the first octet of the address, which would account for aabout 4.2 billion addresses (2^32 - 2^24).

# Looking up addresses

Having used ripe previously I did get slightly surprised that the IP showing was an IPv6 address, and not IPv4 that most of us are used to:
![](/documentation/E03/IPv6.png)

**The results from this address were the following:** 

![](/documentation/E03/RipeResultIPv6.png)

**Disabling IPv6 to test:**

![](/documentation/E03/DisablingIPv6.png)
 
![](/documentation/E03/IPv4.png)
![](/documentation/E03/RipeResultIPv4.png)

```
Having had a look at the search results some parts are more clear than others. \
But the owner of the network range is registred to DNA, which make sense as that is my chosen ISP, and FI - Finland as country. 
Furthermore I find more information about DNA with different addresses and e-mail addresses. Also mentions  FI2G-MNT with description maintainer.

On the IPv4 I recognize more objects than in the IPv6 results. Albeit the results still have a similar structure. 

 I find my currently delegated IP is within the range 89.27.96.0 - 89.27.103.255, and a route to supernet 89.27.0.0/17 is listed.
